# dynamic-parking-pricing
Urban parking lots often suffer from inefficiencies due to static pricing. This project builds a dynamic pricing system for 14 urban parking spaces, using real-time data (occupancy, traffic, events, vehicle types) to adjust prices intelligently. The goal is to improve utilization and maximize revenue.
